# w3bbie like a corporate pivot

## intro

the inspiration to write this came from exiting yet another meeting where the gathering was about status updates and project plans and backlogs. not the actual work-to-be-built. 

_disclaimer: my opinion is biased towards creation - a component of my work smarter not harder campaign. this also is not meant to discourage any future members. also, i'm a nice person who is obsessive about building._

## meet like its a work session hangout

i have attended countless meetings in professional settings. few of these become jam sessions. they feel more like feedback, planning, and time fillers. _confession: i am busy. don't need to look busy._

the appreciation for creation within w3bbie - most members are designers, developers, producers, maker-types - has influenced how we meet. we share a lot of screens, drop a lot of links, trade a lot of files, move a lot of pixels, read through a lot of documentation, push a lot of updates, and maintain a sense of humor even when the tempo is accelerated.

## what chain of command?

the process in w3bbie looks like this: you have an idea? build it. you need support? ask (there is at least one person who will tag-in). 

there is no multi-step approval or pitch process. 

this way of working has lead to more complete projects than incomplete ventures. and even better, members don't feel subordinate or like a dog chasing its tail. 

## it's a <something> product not a process document project

corporate projects tend to be stifled by the pattern of getting stuck in a loop of process documents, backlogs, kanban boards, and gnatt chart type elements. 

reality: the thing being built is not a process document. it is an application. over-indexing on process docs feels inefficient; and causes frustration at the creation-level. 

imagine eating away at three weeks of a four week deadline because of process docs. then telling the development team, "here, build it in a week. we wasted the rest of the time in spreadsheets." i am experiencing this scenario as i type. it is misery.

one of the the safe-havens that w3bbie provides is being liberated from the above working style. 

do we have process docs and other documentation? yes of course. are these the focal point of the operation? no. never. in general, the group understands this: the highest priority is building towards completion of an idea. not idea-ing about the idea until the sands of time reach critical levels.

i think we learned from hackathons that there is not enough time to ideate about what to make. there is only time to iterate on what exists. 

if nothing exists except the idea and some backlog docs, spell t-r-o-u-b-l-e.
