# Organizing and Formatting Content

## Markdown Format
* Use the (draft-template.md)[] file as template.

## How-to Add Content
* Create an issue detailing your content - title and breif description should suffice.
    - also: assign yourself to the issue
* Make a directory within the applicable category
    - example: short-form/<your-content-name>
* Add content to your sub-driectory
    - drafts should be in markdown (.md) format 
    - any other graphic content or supplementary content also goes in your sub-folder.
